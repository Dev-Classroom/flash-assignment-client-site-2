## Assignment Overview

Let's get some styles loaded in! Now that you have the power of CSS selectors, lets create a CSS document and start to style types and create classes. You should be using the same directory/project as your previous assignment from this module. You just need to build on it! We won't get to the layout or responsiveness of this site yet, but we are making incremental progress and taking the necessary steps to ensure our developed version of the site matches the designed version.

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] A `main.css` file <br />
 - [ ] Use of type selectors to add general style rules to HTML elements <br />
 - [ ] Use of class selectors to create specific style rules for certain components <br />
